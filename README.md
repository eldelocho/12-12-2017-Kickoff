# Kickoff / Requirements engineering

First meeting where we started to describe our idea, shared our expectations and had a nice time

# Motivations

* Working among friends, no ties, no stress. Get out of the routine, have a good moment
* Develop skills that can be useful for improving our professional profile
* Be able to mentor others, transmit and sell ideas


# Goals
* in the short term, generate a minimal viable product
* Practice concepts of develop Ideas in teams (for instance design thinking)
* Expand skills in python: for instance upload an image
* New technologies: git, cloud foundry, nodeJS
* learn best practices of clean code



# Functional Requirements
* Tool should be proactive - so before the time to take the medicine, the app reminds
* Tool should be reactive - after having missed the time to take the medicine -> app reminds
* registration of information should be possible in three ways:
1. directly in DB
2. directly in FrontEnd
3. the tool is being "trained" (no registration made by user)



# Technical Requirements




# Tasks to achieve
* Verify if [PyGame](http://pygame.org/wiki/about) is ideal for generating native android app
* Make a comparison of frontEnd technologies to choose the most proper one (React native? Angular? Django? OPENUI5?)
